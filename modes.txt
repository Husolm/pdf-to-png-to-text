9. Treat the image as a single word.

10. Treat the image as a single word in a circle.

11. Treat the image as a single character.

12. Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.

OCR Engine modes:

1. Legacy engine only.
2. Neural nets LSTM engine only.
3. Legacy + LSTM engines.
